# A Halloween-themed group project where the point was showing off animation skills

The first group project i worked on. 
This group projects end goal was to test and showcase the students accumilated animation skills using CSS and HTML,
as well as to test how well the students were able to work in teams and coordinate programming and design efforts to create a
"story" through the animation.
